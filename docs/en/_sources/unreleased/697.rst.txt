    Fixed issue where the CAST applied to a JSON column when copying a SQLite
    table during batch mode would cause the data to be lost, as SQLite's CAST
    with JSON appears to convert the data to the value "0". The CAST is now
    skipped in a dialect-specific manner, including for JSON columns on SQLite.
