    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 786

    Changed the default ordering of "CREATE" and "DROP" statements indexes and
    unique constraints within the autogenerate process, so that for example in
    an upgrade() operation, a particular index or constraint that is to be
    replaced such as for a casing convention change will not produce any naming
    conflicts. For foreign key constraint objects, this is already how
    constraints are ordered, and for table objects, users would normally want
    to use :meth:`.Operations.rename_table` in any case.
