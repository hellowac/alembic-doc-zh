    Made an adjustment to the PostgreSQL dialect to allow it to work more
    effectively in batch mode, where a datatype like Boolean or non-native Enum
    that may have embedded rules to generate CHECK constraints will be more
    correctly handled in that these constraints usually will not have been
    generated on the PostgreSQL backend; previously it would inadvertently
    assume they existed unconditionally in a special PG-only "drop constraint"
    step.
