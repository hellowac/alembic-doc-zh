    The algorithm used for calculating downgrades/upgrades/iterating
    revisions has been rewritten, to resolve ongoing issues of branches
    not being handled consistently particularly within downgrade operations,
    as well as for overall clarity and maintainability.  This change includes
    that a deprecation warning is emitted if an ambiguous command such
    as "downgrade -1" when multiple heads are present is given.

    In particular, the change implements a long-requested use case of allowing
    downgrades of a single branch to a branchpoint.

    Huge thanks to Simon Bowly for their impressive efforts in successfully
    tackling this very difficult problem.
