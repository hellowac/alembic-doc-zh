    The dependency on ``pkg_resources`` which is part of ``setuptools`` has
    been removed, so there is no longer any runtime dependency on
    ``setuptools``. The functionality has been replaced with
    ``importlib.metadata`` and ``importlib.resources`` which are both part of
    Python std.lib, or via pypy dependency ``importlib-metadata`` for Python
    version < 3.8 and ``importlib-resources`` for Python version < 3.7.
