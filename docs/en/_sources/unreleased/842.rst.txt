    Enhance ``version_locations`` parsing to handle paths containing spaces.
    The new configuration option ``version_path_separator`` specifies the
    character to use when splitting the ``version_locations`` string. The
    default for new configurations is ``version_path_separator = os``,
    which will use ``os.pathsep`` (e.g., ``;`` on Windows).
