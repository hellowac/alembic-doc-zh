    Fixed issue where registration of custom ops was prone to failure due to
    the registration process running ``exec()`` on generated code that as of
    the 1.7 series includes pep-484 annotations, which in the case of end user
    code would result in name resolution errors when the exec occurs. The logic
    in question has been altered so that the annotations are rendered as
    forward references so that the ``exec()`` can proceed.
