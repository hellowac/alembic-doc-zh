    The revision tree is now checked for cycles and loops between revision
    files when the revision environment is loaded up.  Scenarios such as a
    revision pointing to itself, or a revision that can reach itself via a
    loop, are handled and will raise the :class:`.CycleDetected` exception when
    the environment is loaded (expressed from the Alembic commandline as a
    failure message and nonzero return code). Previously, these situations were
    silently ignored up front, and the behavior of revision traversal would
    either be silently incorrect, or would produce errors such as
    :class:`.RangeNotAncestorError`.  Pull request courtesy Koichiro Den.
