    :tickets: 650

    Added new hook :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_name`,
    which complements the
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_object` hook by providing
    a means of preventing objects of a certain name from being autogenerated
    **before** the SQLAlchemy reflection process takes place, and notably
    includes explicit support for passing each schema name when
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_schemas` is set to True.
    This is most important especially for enviroments that make use of
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_schemas` where schemas are
    actually databases (e.g. MySQL) in order to prevent reflection sweeps of
    the entire server.

.. change::
    :tags: removed, autogenerate

    The long deprecated
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_symbol` hook is removed.
    The  :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_object`
    and  :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_name`
    hooks both achieve the goals of this hook.
