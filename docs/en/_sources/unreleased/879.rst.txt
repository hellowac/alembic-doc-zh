    Fixed regression due to :ticket:`803` where the ``.info`` and ``.comment``
    attributes of ``Table`` would be lost inside of the :class:`.DropTableOp`
    class, which when "reversed" into a :class:`.CreateTableOp` would then have
    lost these elements. Pull request courtesy Nicolas CANIART.
