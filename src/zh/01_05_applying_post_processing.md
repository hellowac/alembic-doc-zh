# Applying Post Processing and Python Code Formatters to Generated Revisions

[Black]: https://black.readthedocs.io/
[autopep8]: https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/

Revision scripts generated by the `alembic revision` command can optionally be piped through a series of post-production functions which may analyze or rewrite Python source code generated by Alembic, within the scope of running the `revision` command. The primary intended use of this feature is to run code-formatting tools such as [Black] or [autopep8], as well as custom-written formatting and linter functions, on revision files as Alembic generates them. Any number of hooks can be configured and they will be run in series, given the path to the newly generated file as well as configuration options.

The post write hooks, when configured, run against generated revision files regardless of whether or not the autogenerate feature was used.

> New in version 1.2.

> **Note**: Alembic’s post write system is partially inspired by the [pre-commit] tool, which configures git hooks that reformat source files as they are committed to a git repository. Pre-commit can serve this role for Alembic revision files as well, applying code formatters to them as they are committed. Alembic’s post write hooks are useful only in that they can format the files immediately upon generation, rather than at commit time, and also can be useful for projects that prefer not to use pre-commit.
