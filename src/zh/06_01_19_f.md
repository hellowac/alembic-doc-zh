# f

**f**(*name*:  [str]) → sqlalchemy.sql.elements.conv

Indicate a string name that has already had a naming convention applied to it.

This feature combines with the SQLAlchemy `naming_convention` feature to disambiguate constraint names that have already had naming conventions applied to them, versus those that have not. This is necessary in the case that the `"%(constraint_name)s"` token is used within a naming convention, so that it can be identified that this particular name should remain fixed.

If the **[Operations.f()]** is used on a constraint, the naming convention will not take effect:

```python
op.add_column('t', 'x', Boolean(name=op.f('ck_bool_t_x')))
```

Above, the CHECK constraint generated will have the name `ck_bool_t_x` regardless of whether or not a naming convention is in use.

Alternatively, if a naming convention is in use, and ‘f’ is not used, names will be converted along conventions. If the `target_metadata` contains the naming convention `{"ck": "ck_bool_%(table_name)s_%(constraint_name)s"}`, then the output of the following:

```text
op.add_column(‘t’, ‘x’, Boolean(name=’x’))
```

will be:

```python
CONSTRAINT ck_bool_t_x CHECK (x in (1, 0)))
```

The function is rendered in the output of autogenerate when a particular constraint name is already converted.
