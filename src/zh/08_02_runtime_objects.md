# Runtime Objects

[EnvironmentContext]: #alembic.runtime.environment.EnvironmentContext
[MigrationContext]: #alembic.runtime.migration.MigrationContext

The “runtime” of Alembic involves the **[EnvironmentContext]** and **[MigrationContext]** objects. These are the objects that are in play once the `env.py` script is loaded up by a command and a migration operation proceeds.
