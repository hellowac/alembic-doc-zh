    Fixed bug where the "existing_type" parameter, which the MSSQL dialect
    requires in order to change the nullability of a column in the absence of
    also changing the column type, would cause an ALTER COLUMN operation to
    incorrectly render a second ALTER statement without the nullability if a
    new type were also present, as the MSSQL-specific contract did not
    anticipate all three of "nullability", "type_" and "existing_type" being
    sent at the same time.
