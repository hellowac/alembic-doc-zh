    Modified the ``add_column()`` operation such that the ``Column`` object in
    use is shallow copied to a new instance if that ``Column`` is already
    attached to a ``table()`` or ``Table``. This accommodates for the change
    made in SQLAlchemy issue #5618 which prohibits a ``Column`` from being
    associated with multiple ``table()`` objects. This resumes support for
    using a ``Column`` inside of an Alembic operation that already refers to a
    parent ``table()`` or ``Table`` as well as allows operation objects just
    autogenerated to work.
