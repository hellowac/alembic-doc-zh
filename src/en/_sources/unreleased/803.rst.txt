    :tickets: 803

    Refactored the implementation of :class:`.MigrateOperation` constructs such
    as :class:`.CreateIndexOp`, :class:`.CreateTableOp`, etc. so that they no
    longer rely upon maintaining a persistent version of each schema object
    internally; instead, the state variables of each operation object will be
    used to produce the corresponding construct when the operation is invoked.
    The rationale is so that environments which make use of
    operation-manipulation schemes such as those those discussed in
    :ref:`autogen_rewriter` are better supported, allowing end-user code to
    manipulate the public attributes of these objects which will then be
    expressed in the final output, an example is
    ``some_create_index_op.kw["postgresql_concurrently"] = True``.

    Previously, these objects when generated from autogenerate would typically
    hold onto the original, reflected element internally without honoring the
    other state variables of each construct, preventing the public API from
    working.
