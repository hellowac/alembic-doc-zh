    Added support for rendering of "identity" elements on
    :class:`.Column` objects, supported in SQLAlchemy via
    the :class:`.Identity` element introduced in version 1.4.

    Adding columns with identity is supported on PostgreSQL,
    MSSQL and Oracle. Changing the identity options or removing
    it is supported only on PostgreSQL and Oracle.
