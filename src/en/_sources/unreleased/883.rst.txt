    Batch "auto" mode will now select for "recreate" if the ``add_column()``
    operation is used on SQLite, and the column itself meets the criteria for
    SQLite where ADD COLUMN is not allowed, in this case a functional or
    parenthesized SQL expression or a ``Computed`` (i.e. generated) column.
