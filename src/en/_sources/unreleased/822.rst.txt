    Implement a ``.cwd`` (current working directory) suboption for post-write hooks
    (of type ``console_scripts``). This is useful for tools like pre-commit, which
    rely on the working directory to locate the necessary config files. Add
    pre-commit as an example to the documentation. Minor change: rename some variables
    from ticket #819 to improve readability.
